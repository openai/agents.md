[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) is a simple, open format for guiding coding agents.

Think of AGENTS.md as a README for agents: a dedicated, predictable place
to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

Below is a minimal example of an AGENTS.md file:

```markdown
# Sample AGENTS.md file

## Dev environment tips
- Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name>` to jump to a package instead of scanning with `ls`.
- Run `pnpm install --filter <project_name>` to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
- Use `pnpm create vite@latest <project_name> -- --template react-ts` to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.

## Testing instructions
- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.
- Run `pnpm turbo run test --filter <project_name>` to run every check defined for that package.
- From the package root you can just call `pnpm test`. The commit should pass all tests before you merge.
- To focus on one step, add the Vitest pattern: `pnpm vitest run -t "<test name>"`.
- Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.
- After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm lint --filter <project_name>` to be sure ESLint and TypeScript rules still pass.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.

## PR instructions
- Title format: [<project_name>] <Title>
- Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before committing.

## Website

This repository also includes a basic Next.js website hosted at https://agents.md/
that explains the project's goals in a simple way, and featuring some examples.

## AGENTS.ARCH.md

This repository includes an experimental extension to AGENTS.md called `AGENTS.ARCH.md`, 
which focuses on architectural integrity for AI-assisted development. While AGENTS.md 
provides development workflow guidance, AGENTS.ARCH.md adds architectural awareness 
and safety constraints to ensure agents understand system boundaries and maintain 
existing patterns when making changes.

Key features of AGENTS.ARCH.md:
- **System Image Declaration (SID)**: Structured system summary for agent awareness
- **Safe Generation Defaults**: Non-destructive changes with explicit permission requirements
- **Agent Snapshot Protocol**: Structured understanding verification
- **Violation Logging**: Clear reporting of constraint breaches
- **Architectural Pattern Enforcement**: Maintains existing design patterns

This is an experimental specification designed for complex, interdependent codebases 
where architectural integrity is critical.

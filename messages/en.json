    "title": "Why AGENTS.md?",
    "paragraph1": "README.md files are for humans: quick starts, project descriptions, and contribution guidelines.",
    "paragraph2": "AGENTS.md complements this by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a README or aren't relevant to human contributors.",
    "paragraph3": "We intentionally kept it separate to:",
    "reason1Title": "Give agents a clear, predictable place for instructions.",
    "reason2Title": "Keep READMEs concise and focused on human contributors.",
    "reason3Title": "Provide precise, agent-focused guidance that complements existing README and docs.",
    "paragraph4": "Rather than introducing another proprietary file, we chose a name and format that could work for anyone. If you're building or using coding agents and find this helpful, feel free to adopt it."

    "step1Body": "Create an AGENTS.md file at the root of the repository. Most coding agents can even scaffold one for you if you ask nicely.",

    "step4Title": "Large monorepo? Use nested AGENTS.md files for subprojects",
    "step4Body": "Place another AGENTS.md inside each package. Agents automatically read the nearest file in the directory tree, so the closest one takes precedence and every subproject can ship tailored instructions. For example, at time of writing the main OpenAI repo has 88 AGENTS.md files."

  "faq": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "question1": "Are there required fields?",
    "answer1": "No. AGENTS.md is just standard Markdown. Use any headings you like; the agent simply parses the text you provide.",
    "question2": "What if instructions conflict?",
    "answer2": "The closest AGENTS.md to the edited file wins; explicit user chat prompts override everything.",
    "question3": "Will the agent run testing commands found in AGENTS.md automatically?",
    "answer3": "Yes—if you list them. The agent will attempt to execute relevant programmatic checks and fix failures before finishing the task.",
    "question4": "Can I update it later?",
    "answer4": "Absolutely. Treat AGENTS.md as living documentation.",

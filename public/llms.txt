**AGENTS.md** is a simple, open format for guiding AI coding agents, used by over 20,000 open-source projects. Think of it as a **README for agents** - a dedicated, predictable place to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work effectively on your project.

## What is AGENTS.md?

AGENTS.md emerged from collaborative efforts across the AI software development ecosystem, including OpenAI Codex, Amp, Jules from Google, Cursor, and Factory. It complements README.md files by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a README or aren't relevant to human contributors.
